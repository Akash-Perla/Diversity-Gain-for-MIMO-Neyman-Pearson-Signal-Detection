Implemented the paper "Diversity Gain for MIMO Neyman Pearson Signal Detection" which was published in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, March 2011

Overall Flow:

- Calculate the matrix A (Eq. 64)
- First we create the matrix Sn (Eq. 63)
- Then create C (Eq. 62)
- Then we create r, where zeta and w are generated using the random function (Eq 61)
- Then create the test statistic T (Eq 12)
